Popularity Score Algorithm
// Weighted scoring formula
popularityScore = (
  (views × VIEWS_WEIGHT) +
  (likes × LIKES_WEIGHT) +
  (purchases × PURCHASES_WEIGHT)
) × timeDecayFactor

// Time decay formula (exponential decay)
const ageInDays = (now - publishDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
const HALF_LIFE_DAYS = 7; // Article loses 50% boost after 7 days
timeDecayFactor = Math.pow(2, -ageInDays / HALF_LIFE_DAYS);

// Weights
VIEWS_WEIGHT = 1
LIKES_WEIGHT = 10      // Likes worth 10x views
PURCHASES_WEIGHT = 50  // Purchases worth 50x views
