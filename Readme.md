Penny.io is a Medium.com alternative for tech & crypto enthusiasts / writes that takes advantage of the x402 payment protocol. 

Key features and functionality as described below: 

Why This Could Be Revolutionary
The Current Problem:

Traditional blogs: Free but cluttered with ads, or paywalled with expensive subscriptions ($5-15/month)
Medium charges $5/month even if you only want to read 2 articles
Writers struggle to monetize unless they have huge audiences
Readers hate being locked into subscriptions for occasional content

Core focus (for now):
Knowledge Marketplace: Technical tutorials, research papers, code snippets - specialized content worth paying for

The x402 Solution:

Pay $0.01-0.25 per article you actually read
Writers get paid instantly (2 seconds, not 30 days)
No accounts, no subscriptions, no payment forms
AI agents can read and pay for content autonomously

Product Features You Could Build
Core Platform:

Clean, distraction-free reading experience (like Medium or Substack)
Writers set their own price per article ($0.01 - $1.00)
Instant payouts to writers' wallets
x402 integration handles all payments automatically

Smart Features:

Preview mode: First 3 paragraphs free, pay to unlock the rest
