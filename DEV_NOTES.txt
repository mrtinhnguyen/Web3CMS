Coinbase Wallet Localhost Configuration

  Option 1: Quick Fix (No Developer Account Needed)

  For development/testing, you can bypass this by:

  1. Use MetaMask instead - it doesn't have this restriction
  2. Use WalletConnect - Coinbase Wallet supports WalletConnect protocol
  3. Test on a deployed domain - deploy to Vercel/Netlify for testing

  Option 2: Proper Setup (Recommended for Production)

  1. Create Coinbase Developer Account: https://developers.coinbase.com/
  2. Register your app in the Coinbase Developer Portal
  3. Add localhost domains to allowed origins:
    - http://localhost:3000
    - http://127.0.0.1:3000
    - http://localhost:3001 (if needed for backend)
  4. Get your App ID and add it to the wagmi config

  Option 3: Update wagmi.ts with App ID (when you have it)

  export const config = getDefaultConfig({
    appName: 'Penny.io',
    projectId: 'YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID',
    chains: [mainnet, polygon, optimism, arbitrum, base, baseSepolia],
    // Add this when you get it from Coinbase Developer Portal
    coinbaseWalletOptions: {
      appName: 'Penny.io',
      appLogoUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/logo.png', // Optional
    },
    ssr: false,
  });
